This analysis is done as a part of Udacity Data Science Nano degree course. 
It utilises the Kaggle data for airbnb accomodations in two cities: Seattle and Boston in 2016-17 years.
I have used the following libraries in my analysis: pandas, import_ipynb, matplotlib,sklearn

The aim of this study is to learn the following:
1. What city has higher proces for Airbnb accomodations? Answer: Boston is more expensive.
3. Are reviews important drivers of prices? Answer: physical attributes are more important. 
4. What host attributes increase price: airbnb experience, spead of reply? Answer: such attributes do not have much impact.
5. Has prices change in 2017 comparing to 2016? How?: Prices decreased but result is inconclusive because Seattle has only 2017 data for January.
6. What is the cheapest time for a tourist to visit these cities? Answer: Both cities have cheapest accomodations in Q1.
